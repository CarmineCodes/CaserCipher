# CaserCipher
a program intended to be used to encrypt and decrypt user input using the Caser Cipher
the cipher.java file is the base code used to operate the cipher; it runs in a terminal and prompts the user to input the necessary input to use the cipher
the caeserciphergui.java file is home to the gui used to run the cipher. it is currently still being worked on and only displays the gui but does not output an encrypted text yet
